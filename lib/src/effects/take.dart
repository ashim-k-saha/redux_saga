///  Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified
///  action on the Store or if provided on the [channel].
///  The Generator is suspended until an action that matches [pattern] is dispatched.
///
///  The result of `yield Take(pattern : pattern)` is an action object being dispatched.
///
///  [pattern] is interpreted using the following rules:
///
///  - If `Take` is called without pattern argument or `'*'` all dispatched actions are
///  matched (e.g. `Take()` will match all actions).
///
///  - If it is a function, the action is matched if `pattern(action)` is true.
///
///  - If it is a Type, the action is matched through its type.
///  The logic is `action.runtimeType === pattern` (e.g. `Take(pattern: IncrementAsync)`.
///  Type matcher may be enough to solve most scenarios. It is also type safe and easy to use.
///
///  - If it is a String, the action is matched if its type name as string equals the String.
///  The logic is `action.runtimeType.toString() === pattern` (e.g. `Take(pattern: 'IncrementAsync')`.
///
///  - If it is an array, each item in the array is accepted as pattern and all must match,
///  so the mixed array of types, strings and function predicates is supported.
///  The most common use case is an array of types though, so that action type is matched against
///  all items in the array (e.g. `Take(pattern: [Increment, Decrement])` and that would match either
///  actions of type `Increment` or `Decrement`).
///
///  The middleware provides a special action [End]. If you dispatch the [End] action, then all
///  Sagas blocked on a Take Effect will be terminated regardless of the specified pattern.
///  If the terminated Saga has still some forked tasks which are still running, it will wait
///  for all the child tasks to terminate before terminating the [Task].
///
